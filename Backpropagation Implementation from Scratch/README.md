**Backpropagation Implementation from Scratch**

This repository contains an implementation of the Backpropagation algorithm from scratch, without relying on any pre-existing deep learning libraries. 
The purpose of this implementation is to gain a deep understanding of the inner workings of Backpropagation and how it facilitates training deep neural networks.

**Task 1:** Implementing Forward propagation,
Backpropagation and Gradient checking.

**Task 2** : How to use DL Optimizers
